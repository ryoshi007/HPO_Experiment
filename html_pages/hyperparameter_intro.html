        <h1>Half Grid Search</h1>
        <p>Successive halving, a form of budget allocation strategy, is part of the broader family of algorithms known
            as bandit-based methods. It begins with a large number of candidate hyperparameter configurations and a
            small amount of resources allocated to each. Resources here typically refer to the number of data points
            used or the number of iterations allowed for each candidate's initial assessment.</p>
